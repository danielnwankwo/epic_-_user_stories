# User Story cases

## How to Write user stories

- **User personas**, for whom?
- **outline subtasks or tasks**, Decide which specific steps need to be completed and who is responsible for each of them.
- **Ordered Steps**, Write a story for each step in a larger process
- **Listen to feedback**, Talk to your users and capture the problem or need in their words
- **Time**, 
- **Definition of “Done**, The story is generally “done” when the user can complete the outlined task
