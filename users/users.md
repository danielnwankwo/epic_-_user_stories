# User stories

- not simply software system requirements
- the smallest unit of work in an agile framework
- It’s an end goal, not a feature, expressed from the software user’s perspective
- a non-technical, general explanation of a software feature written from the perspective of the end user or customer 
- They are the building blocks of  larger Agile frameworks like Epics and Initiatives
