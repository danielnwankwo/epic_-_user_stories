# Epics

- are **large bodies of work** that can be broken down into a number of smaller tasks (stories)
- serves to manage a task
- segmented into specific tasks based on the needs and/or requirements of the client
- create hierachy 
- Important in order to maintain agility

- Ideally an epic should give the develpment team everything they require in order to be successful 

- Epics are derived from _Initiatives_, which are derived from the _Product Roadmap_

**Product Roadmap**

- a plan of action for how a product or solution will evolve over time

**Initiatives**

- An expression or visualisation of the _Product Roadmap_ plotted along a timeline
- There will be a set of these per _Product Roadmap_

- These _Initiatives_ are then broken down into epics.
- A set of completed epics drives a specific initiative, which keeps the overall product developing and evolving with market and customer demands on top of organizational themes
