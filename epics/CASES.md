# Epics cases

- An example epic, “March 2050 Space Tourism Launch” includes stories for routine work items as well as stories aimed to improve key aspects of the shuttle launch.
- these aspects may range from customers buying tickets, all the way to the actual launch procedure.
- Therefore multiple teams would be involved in handling and contributing to this epic by working on an array of stories.


# Example stories

 **Story1** 

- Update date range to include March 2050 Launch dates

 **Story2**

- Reduce load time for requested flight listings to < 0.45 seconds

 **Story3**

- Promote Saturn Summer Sale on confirm page for First Class bookings.




- As previously mentioned earlier several teams may be working on an Epic at any given time therefore, other teams may also contribute stories to the Epic
